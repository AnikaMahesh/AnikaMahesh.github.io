        <h2>Documented Performance of Off the shelf Color Correction Algorithms on Deep Sea Footage- Spring 2025</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Color correction is important to remove haze and light attenuation on underwater images however most of these algorithms are built for coastal regions where there is a lot lighter. This project aimed to test the functionality of these algorithms deep in ocean.</li>
            <li>Read literature on underwater color corrections and chose a few off the shelf algorithms to test on a deep-sea dataset of hydrothermal vents</li>
            <li>Made qualitative observations on the performance of different algorithms</li>
            <li>Attempted to use light enhancing algorithms to brighten deep sea imagery after color correction which resulted in information loss and amplification of errors in color correction.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Fine-tuned Whisper for stuttering speech in both English and Mandarin </li>
            <li>One of the major constraints we faced was limited GPU access, so we had to be strategic with our training running intermediate models, experimenting with learning rates, and choosing a cloud computing platform to use. We Experimented with Google Colab and Amazon Sage maker for High Performance Computing.</li>
            <li>In the end, we achieved a 14.2% reduction in Word Error Rate for English and a 47.4% reduction in Character Error Rate for Mandarin and presented our findings as a poster at the AAAS conference.</li>

            <li>We created our own astromech which we could drive around and control with a remote controller connected to the robot via Bluetooth. It also beeped if it detected a person in front of it. I led the electrical and software integration for the robot system.</li>
            <li> I implemented the camera and speaker integration for the robot head as well as the motor system for the head and drive motors. I also worked on the Bluetooth connection on the robot side. I did all the voltage calculations and installed necessary estops and fuses to ensure the robot was safe.</li>
            <li> Debugged Electrical System with Oscilloscope and multimeter to verify system functioning when the motor stalls and signals sent to the sabertooth motor controller and the microstep driver were in the valid format.</li>
